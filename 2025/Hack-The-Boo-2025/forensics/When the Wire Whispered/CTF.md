CHALLENGE NAME
When The Wire Whispered
Brynn’s night-threads flared as connections vanished and reappeared in reverse, each route bending back like a reflection misremembered. The capture showed silent gaps between fevered bursts—packets echoing out of sequence, jittering like whispers behind glass. Eira and Cordelia now sift the capture, tracing the pattern’s cadence to learn whether it’s mere corruption… or the Hollow King learning to speak through the wire. Note: Make sure you are using Wireshark v4.6.0+ Note2: Use PyRDP *git* version
